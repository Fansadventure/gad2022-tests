# How to use test from SS 21

## Load content from submodule

After you have cloned the repository execute the following two commands:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Linux
On linux you can just use the test from the last semster now, because there is a symbolic link.

### Windows
On Windows you have to manually copy the file.
Just go into the folder `TUM_GAD_Tests_SS21`, find the test and copy it.
